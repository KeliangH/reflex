OVERVIEW
========

Reflex is a package for real-time robot control.  It includes the
following:

* Workspace (Cartesian) Control for Robot Arms
  - Generates kinematics code in C from URDF
* Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control and Estimation
  - Compute optimal Kalman/LQR gains
  - Discrete Kalman Filter
  - Extended Kalman Filter
  - Continuous Kalman-Bucy Filter
  - LQR Controller

INSTALLATION
============

    ./configure && make && make install

See the INSTALL file for details.

WORKSPACE CONTROL
=================

* To generate code from URDF, see ./scripts/rfx-urdfc.  Basic usage is
  `rfx-urdfc myrobot.urdf`.  For details, do `rfx-urdfc --help`.

DEMOS
=====

rfx-trajgen
-----------

The rfx-trajgen program will covert a set of waypoints to a dense
trajecory.  See `man rfx-trajgen` for details.

rfx-camcal
----------
The rfx-camcal program will find a camera transform based on
corresponding camera and forward-kinematic pose estimates.

Example
=======

See the file cartpend.c for an example of how to do LQG filtering and
control.
